# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Overview of the Analysis:
  Pewlett Hackard needed an analysis of their employees. The specific data includes retirement information, how retired employees decreases the company's staffing number, and how to keep employees at Pewlett Hackard. A mentorship program was discussed to help engage the retired employees, or future retired employees, to become a part-time mentor. Then the company would be able to keep their staffing numbers and help continue to increase the compnay's value aong their employees.
  An entity relationship diagram (ERD) was created to show the relationships among the company's data. When you look at this ERD provided below, you can clearly visualize what data is measured and how this data can be analyzed.

Summary:
Currently there are 72,458 employees that are elgible to retire soon. Due to the small number of employees elgible to mentor (1,549 employees are elgible) the company should consider chaning their mentoring guidelines so that more people are able to want to stay at the company to keep the company numbers up.
